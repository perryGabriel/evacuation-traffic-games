# evacuation-traffic-games
A simulation framework for studying emergency evacuation traffic on arterial road networks using queueing models and traffic-signal control. The project compares local and coordinated intersection policies under extreme demand to understand congestion, fairness, and systemic inefficiencies during evacuations.
